I attended the Society of Neuroscience Conference 2024 from 10.07-10.09 in Chicago and presented a poster of our work on the feedback modulation of Hebbian plasticity enabling efficient learning in Hopfield networks. This travel was supported partially by the Travel Award from the Wu Tsai Institute at Yale.
