I am a Swartz Postdoc Fellow of Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience working with [Dr. Shreya Saxena](https://www.saxenalab.org/) at [Wu Tsai Institute](https://wti.yale.edu/), Yale University. From 2022.02 to 2024.08, I was a Postdoc Research Associate working with [Dr. ShiNung Ching](https://braindynamics.engineering.wustl.edu/) at the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis. I received my PhD degree in System and Control in 2022 from the University of Groningen, the Netherlands. Before that, I obtained Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering respectively in China. 

My research interests lie in the emerging field of Neuro-AI, specifically the intersection of Computational & Theoretical Neuroscience, Artificial & Biological Neural Networks, Dynamical Systems & Control Theory, and Game Theory & Network Science}. I am particularly interested in their applications in Cognitive Science (such as learning, memory, and decision-making) and Nature/Machine Intelligence, as well as in the realms of Complex Biological and Social Systems.
